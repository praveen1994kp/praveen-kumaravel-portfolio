                    Hi, my name is<br /> Praveen Kumaravel. I am a full stack web developer who wants to create things
                    that
                    make a difference.

                <p>I learned to code and started solving problems for enterprise clients in 2016 as a Java Developer. I
                    focused on
                    creating APIs using Spring Boot, Mule ESB on the initial days. After a while I began leaning towards
                    making websites using React and thus began my journey as a <strong>full stack web
                        developer.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Now I am a polyglot coder with years of experience on different stacks of web applications that drive
                    big
                    business</p>
