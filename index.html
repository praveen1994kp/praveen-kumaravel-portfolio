                        <p>
                            Joined as a trainee who just graduated and began by working for a banking client.
                            My first project involved analyzing a legacy spring application and rewriting it
                            with <strong>spring boot</strong>, modularizing into
                            <strong>micro services</strong> that cater multiple client apps.
                            My role, primarily was to develop RESTful APIs based on the specs. <br />
                            Later, I taught myself to work with <strong>Mule ESB</strong> and integrate
                            multiple REST APIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I gained more skills and reputation, I moved to contribute to a more critical
                            project that helped banking customers to login and manage their mortgage bank accounts.
                            This was a rewrite too, from the boring monolithic application to the more fun Microservice
                            based
                            Single Page App. My role was to develop RESTful APIs based SLAs using Spring Boot and Mule
                            ESB.
                            I also got to work on critical batch jobs using <strong>Spring Batch</strong>, analyze and
                            fix
                            performance issues when the app was
                            used in realtime by huge volumes of users. Our team was responsible for the entire app,
                            right up
                            to the production environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All the applications ran on on-prem server machines.
                        </p>
                        <p>It was a great fun-filled learning experience with Tata Consultancy Services,
                            where I learnt the fundamentals about backend of modern web applications</p>

                            Moved on to start learning front end application frameworks.
                            I started contributing to the development of a ticketing tool for Verizon. It was
                            a major rewrite, primarily of the UI from Anglular to <strong>React</strong>.
                            My role involved development of complex UI components to legibly present complex
                            data that served technicians to monitor tickets and fix them.
                            I gained good experience in making different kinds of table components and forms
                            that present large volumes of data. I also occasionaly contributed to creating
                            and tweaking microservices written using <strong>Nodejs</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Later I moved on to another project where I contributed to the development of a
                            new application that encapsulated the functionalities of multiple legacy apps.
                            My role was to develop dashboards with widgets that were developed with the
                            intent of making every asset of the application <strong>reusable</strong> and ready to be
                            plugged
                            in to any app that ran on the same ecosystem.
                            I had also contributed to the implementation of REST apis using Nodejs.
                            With my expertise on react, I worked on making the front end application
                            more performant, analyzed and <strong>fixed
                                performance issues</strong>, leveraging the latest features provided by the framework.
                            After I gained expertise on different stacks of the application, I started <strong>managing
                                PRs, maintained several repositories</strong> and played a part on
                            <strong>making technical design
                                decisions</strong> for new features.
                            I also got to work on creating and managing containers with Docker and Kubernetes, and
                            also contributed to creating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then moved on to another project that was critical to running the business.
                            My role was to develop UI components, majority of which dealt with creating forms
                            to query huge volumes of realtime data from druid. The data was presented on
                            a wide range of UI elements ranging from primitive tables and forms to more complex
                            UI elements like maps.
                        </p>
                        <p>It was when working for Verizon, where I found my true passion towards coding on
                            different stacks of modern web applications.
